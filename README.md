# MISSION TO MARS

## Overview :

 In this project, we are organizing , analyisng and visulaizing the information about the climate of Mars by performing web-scraping and data analysis.

 Resources :
  - Data Source : Mars News ,  Mars Temperature Data
  - Software : Python, JupyterNotebook
  - Libraries: BeautifulSoup, Splinter

## Analysis :

### Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News 
   - Using Splinter, automated browsing has been established. Then the page has been inspected using ChromeDevTools and identified all the major elements present in Mars News.
   - Using BeautifulSoup all the News page has been parsed and all text elements have been extracted
   - The title and preview of each article are stored in as dictionary and collectively all these dictionaries have been added and stored as python list
   - Finally the mars data has been exported into json 

### Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data

   - First automated browsing has been established using splinter for the mars temperature data which is in form of html table
   - Next, BeautifulSoup has been used to scrape the data in the HTML table.
   - The scraped data has been assembled into Pandas DataFrame.
 
 Upon extracting Mars temperature table, the table has been used to analyse and visulaize the data by finding answers to the below questions.

* How many months exist on Mars? 

        12 months exist in Mars
        
* How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?
        
        1867 martian days exist in the scraped data
* What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)? 
    
        The anlysis show that Mars is the coldest month and August being the warmest

* Find the average the minimum daily temperature for all of the months.
Plot the results as a bar chart.

* Average daily atmospheric pressure of all the months on Mars
Plot the results as a bar chart.
