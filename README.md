# MISSION TO MARS

## Overview :

 In this project, we are organizing , analyisng and visualizing the information about the climate of Mars by performing web-scraping and data analysis.

 ## Resources :
  - Data Source : Mars News ,  Mars Temperature Data
  - Software : Python, JupyterNotebook
  - Libraries: BeautifulSoup, Splinter

## Analysis :

### Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News 
   - Using Splinter, automated browsing has been established. Then the page has been inspected using ChromeDevTools and identified all the major elements present in Mars News.
   - Using BeautifulSoup all the News page has been parsed and all text elements have been extracted
   - The title and preview of each article are stored in as dictionary and collectively all these dictionaries have been added and stored as python list
   - Finally the mars data has been exported into json 

Json Output File : [mars_data.json](https://github.com/hsurisetti/Mission_to_Mars/blob/main/mars_data.json)

### Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data

   - First automated browsing has been established using splinter for the mars temperature data which is in the form of html table
   - Next, BeautifulSoup has been used to scrape the data in the HTML table.
   - The scraped data has been assembled into Pandas DataFrame.

Mars DataFrame csv File : [mars_table.csv](https://github.com/hsurisetti/Mission_to_Mars/blob/main/mars_table.csv)
 
 Upon extracting Mars temperature table, the table has been used to analyse and visualize the data by finding answers to the below questions.

* How many months exist on Mars? 

    Based on the analysis we can see that 12 months exist in Mars

* How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?
        
    Based on the 'sol' data in the dataframe , we can see that 1867 martian days exist in the scraped data

* What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)? 
    
    The anlysis show that March is the coldest month and August being the warmest

* Find the average the minimum daily temperature for all of the months.
Plot the results as a bar chart.

* Average daily atmospheric pressure of all the months on Mars
Plot the results as a bar chart.
